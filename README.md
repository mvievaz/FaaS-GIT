      FaaS-GIT
  <br/>
</h1>

Function-as-a-Service(FaaS) is a revolutionary paradigm, redefining how 
applications are developed, deployed, and scaled. FaaS represents a serverless 
computing model where developers can focus solely on writing code without the 
burden of managing underlying infrastructure. This revolutionary approach 
enables efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solutions, unlocking new 
possibilities for application architecture. 

We designed a FaaS for git public projects as the central project of one 
Master's subject, SAD (*Servicios y Aplicaciones Distribuidas*). On the next 
lines we explain how to deploy the project and test it. In addition, we 
describe how this git public projects must be built to use it on the FaaS.
